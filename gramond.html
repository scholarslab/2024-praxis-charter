<h2>What Are My Goals for the Year</h2>
<p>A major goal for this year is to embrace the unknowns of digital humanities and Praxis rather than stressing about my limitations and shortcomings. In having some exposure to digital humanities, I hope to learn new practices and techniques beyond ArcGIS while sharpening the technical and non-technical skills I already possess. I plan to take advantage of this interdisciplinary opportunity in being exposed to the unique perspectives that my cohorts will bring to the Praxis team and the Scholars Lab.</p>

<h2>How does your field inform your comprehension of collaboration?</h2>
<p>At the graduate level, collaboration is very essential to success in the field of history. During coursework, many classes have components of collaboration such as working with a partner or partners to facilitate weekly discussions. There are aspects such as researching and writing history that are very individualistic, but presenting at conferences with scholars, both historians and others, who work on themes similar to your own involves collaboration. However, this collaboration can involve both equal and unequal hierarchies based on prestige and position. Historians are often involved in interdisciplinary projects for their expertise in history on work often meant to be presented to the general public. My own work has seen me collaborate with local community organizations as well as larger organizations like the National Park Service.</p>

<h2>What do you spend time on?</h2>
<p>Academically, research and writing (at least I try to). On the side, I like listening to music and watching sports, especially football and basketball. I am a road geek, so when I do not have the opportunity to drive, I like watching videos of others traveling to places across the country. </p>

<h2>What is a major issue/challenge/bone of contention in your field?</h2>
<p>Within the U.S. related to American history, a major issue concerns outside political pressure over what can and should be taught in schools and universities about American history. As I view African American history as a crucial part of American history, there is pressure in certain states to teach a sanitized version of history that highlights the positives of American history while ignoring or glossing over negative aspects like slavery and racial injustice.</p>

<h2>What don't people understand about something you work on?</h2>
<p>Part of my dilemma in researching a city like Orlando is that most people associate the city with Disney World and nothing else. Yet, my research seeks to decentralize Disney from the story of the rise of Orlando and present this new narrative about the city built on the duality of growth and inequality.</p>
