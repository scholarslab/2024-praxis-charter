<h2> What are your personal aspirations?</h2>
<p>Work: to do what I can to make it possible for my colleagues in the Lab, and across the Library where possible, to work in ways that honor their humanity and honor their dignity and their agency.</p>
<p>Personal: to travel as much as I can before old age takes away my ability to experience other places, people, and cultures. Or to become of forest hag and renounce the world of man once and for all. I go back and forth.</p>

<h2> What aspirations do you have for working with us?</h2>
<p>You’re my colleagues while you’re in Praxis. My aspirations for you are the same as for any other colleague.</p>
<h2> What does collaboration mean to you?</h2>
<p>Mutual responsibility for and accountability to the project. Clear and direct communication.</p>
<h2> What do you spend time on?</h2>
<p>Email triage, making the Lab a hospitable and approachable place (space and people, but mostly people), trying to apply my training as a personal coach to my work with others.</p>
<h2>If I were a song, I would be…</h2>
