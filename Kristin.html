    <h1>Kristin</h1>
    <h2>What are my goals for the year?</h2>
    <p>This year, I want to become more comfortable with technical tools and explore new creative avenues. I also want to really embrace the opportunities we have for collaborative work. I do a fair amount of collaboration in music projects, but Praxis offers opportunities for methods of collaboration that I have not really been exposed to very much. In general, I would like to learn a lot of new things that I can apply to collaborative work, and that will inform the way I approach my own music writing & performance projects.</p>

    <h2>What do you spend time on?</h2>
    <p>Probably too many things! Haha. I love playing music, writing music, listening to music, spending time outside sitting under trees & watching birds, baking…I could go on and on! I also enjoy photography and interior decorating (although I am very much an amateur at both of these!).</p>

    <h2>What is a major issue/challenge/bone of contention in your field?</h2>
    <p>Because music and art can be very subjective, an issue I’ve dealt with is differences in aesthetics. My aesthetic preferences are sometimes quite different from those of other composers and artists, so sometimes I run into disagreements, but I think an important part of sharing work is to be able to have differences in style and still be open to digesting lots of different types of work.</p>

    <h2>What don't people understand about something you work on?</h2>
    <p>I think people don’t always understand how varied my work can be…when I say I do music, the first question is always “What instruments do you play?” That is of course a huge part of who I am as a musician, but I do a wide variety of things in music and it can feel hard to explain everything. Also, sometimes I do unconventional things with music, and if a project doesn’t fit into someone’s preconceived notion, it can be hard to explain the project’s gist and purpose.</p>

    <h2>If I were a song, I would be...</h2>
    <p>This is a difficult question!! I have way too many favorites. Here are a couple of them:
